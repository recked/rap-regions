####What makes an artist eligible:
- They started in industry between the '70s-2005
- Are somewhat 'mainstream' and recognizable. They aren't still selling mixtapes out of their trunk.
- Have an artist page on Spotify (so people can listen to their top tracks!)


####How to contribute:
1. Add artists to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtYg9txPzYFBdHRoSHpUc3pyYWZtYlFzWTVJckJ0cFE&usp=sharing) 
     Data needed:
